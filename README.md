## Diverse Assets
Diverse Assets: Instructional materials should employ a diverse range of images and cultural perspectives on course content.

- What readings can be included in the course that represent diverse perspectives on course content?
- What images and examples can be used that increase the diversity presented in class?  
- What social issues are appropriate to discuss in class, and how can these issues be incorporated to course content?

| AI, Data Science, Tech Ethics | Slides with discussion prompts related to ethics in AI and technology development. Students were assigned readings from Future Ethics, by Cennydd Bowles, and these informed most discussions. Folder includes slide deck templates that can be collaboratively edited by student groups after their discussions, and then presented to the class. | [Technology Ethics discussion slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TV3CgrtV3feE6WeTx8zSG3Ioo32TyAw_?usp=drive_link) |

## Identity Connections
Identity Connections: Courses should provide an opportunity for students to connect with new course knowledge from their unique cultural perspectives.
What choice or agency can be given to students in how the classroom is managed?
How can course projects be made more open-ended to allow students to explore matters of interest to them?
How can course assignments and activities better give students a platform to express their unique experiences and strengths?

## Meaning Making
Meaning Making: The learning experience should value the education of the whole individual.  This means crafting opportunities for reflection on learning and connection with one’s lived experience.

- How should reflection opportunities be incorporated into the course?  Should they be required?  
- How can the course provide opportunities for students to share experiences with one another?  
- How can we ensure this is done in a supportive way?

| AI | After learning the basics of agents, students met in groups to develop their own “dream” AI. They presented the idea (including how it fit in the definition of an intelligent agent) to instructorm who pretended to be a VC with funding - and were competing for my millions of pretend dollars. | See [AI Agent Design document](https://github.com/eloncs/ibics/blob/main/meaningMaking/AI_agentDesign_groupDiscussion.pdf) in repository |
| Any course | Utilize monthly anonymous survey to get feedback. Works well for students who are nervous about speaking up in class. | [Survey Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhSjLsMhXzf8Jbn7yN6fXAvA_IKYwJjZNAGW1MsbQTU/edit?tab=t.0) |

## Survey Instrument
To evalute the impact of our interventions, we distributed a survey instrument across to students in courses across our department. Some were taught by instructors participating in this reasearch, and others were not. Our survey instrument is included in the repository [here](https://github.com/eloncs/ibics/blob/5290affa70fd98136134062c7e571a0b6c635975/surveyInstrument/Survey_PrePost_CRT_Evaluation.pdf)
