Diverse Assets: Instructional materials should employ a diverse range of images and cultural perspectives on course content.

- What readings can be included in the course that represent diverse perspectives on course content?
- What images and examples can be used that increase the diversity presented in class?  
- What social issues are appropriate to discuss in class, and how can these issues be incorporated to course content?
