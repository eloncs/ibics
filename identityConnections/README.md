# Identity Connections

Courses should provide an opportunity for students to connect with new course knowledge from their unique cultural perspectives.

- What choice or agency can be given to students in how the classroom is managed?
- How can course projects be made more open-ended to allow students to explore matters of interest to them?
- How can course assignments and activities better give students a platform to express their unique experiences and strengths?
