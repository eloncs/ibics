# Meaning Making

The learning experience should value the education of the whole individual.  This means crafting opportunities for reflection on learning and connection with one’s lived experience.

- How should reflection opportunities be incorporated into the course?  Should they be required?  
- How can the course provide opportunities for students to share experiences with one another?  
- How can we ensure this is done in a supportive way?
