to promote meta-learning.
• Resources for adding “ethical reflections” to common CS1
lessons [19].
• An active learning lesson in which students discuss in groups
their “dream AI” and try to convince others of its positive
impact.
• Surveys that can be periodically given in any course to help
students reflect on their learning process, their experiences
overcoming challenges, and how they can change to find
more success."
